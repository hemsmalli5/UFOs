# UFO Sightings Webpage

The UFO Sightings webpage with dynamic table is indentd to audience interested in UFO observation data. The dynamic table allows user to filter their search and retrive specific UFO information based on date, city, state, country, and or UFO shape. The ability to pinpoint a search will providie more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

For this project we are using JavaScript to access json raw data and provide dynamic web results through HTML page buildout. 
The goals of this project is to:
	Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
	Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
	Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

### Recommendation:
Which the dymanic table already provides user requirements, the project can be improvised with more interesting facts such as average UFO duration timings, or even visualization summary table of average or total UFO findinds based on specific search results.
